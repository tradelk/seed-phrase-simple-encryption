# Seed Phrase Encryptor

A simple Python utility that encrypts a 12-word cryptocurrency seed phrase using a personal text phrase as the encryption key.

This tool allows you to store only:
1. Your personal phrase (plain text)
2. The resulting encrypted key (generated by this script)

The seed phrase can later be recovered only with the same personal phrase.

## 🔐 How it works

- Your personal phrase is converted into a 32-byte AES-256 key using SHA-256.
- The seed phrase is encrypted using **AES-256-CBC** with a random IV.
- The output is a single Base64-encoded string that you can safely store.

This provides a simple, understandable layer of protection — ideal for educational use or lightweight personal encryption.

> This script is not intended as a replacement for professional-grade, audited security tools.  
> Use at your own risk if storing real cryptocurrency seed phrases.
